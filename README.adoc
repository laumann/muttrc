Mutt configuration
==================

This is my +mutt+ configuration. I keep it here for the purpose of backup, in case
I ever need to setup +mutt+ again. Obviously no passwords, emails or user names
are kept here.

Setup
-----

Assuming +mutt+ is already installed, clone this repository to +~/.mutt+

----
git clone https://github.com/laumann/muttrc.git ~/.mutt
----

and replace the variables +USER+, +PASSWORD+ and +NAME+ with appropriate values.
You should be good to go!
